  // I've tried other workarounds such as explicitly terminating via `process.exit`, passing a
  // callback to `writeStream.write` (ensuring the returned `Promise` is not resolved until it is
  // called), and explicitly calling `writeStream.end`/`writeStream.uncork` and so far this is the
  // only workaround which reliably results in the desired behavior.
