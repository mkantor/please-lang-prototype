# Please

An exploratory programming language.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mkantor/please-prototype.git
cd please-prototype
npm install
npm run build
echo '{@runtime context => :context.program.start_time}' | ./please --output-format=json
```

## What this repository is

**This implementation of Please is a proof of concept**. There are plenty of bugs and missing
pieces, and language syntax/semantics may change backwards-incompatibly on the way to an official
release. This implementation is not particularly focused on performance, robustness, or developer
experienceâ€”it's merely a place to experiment with ideas for the language. TypeScript was chosen
because it's pretty good for rapid prototyping, but it's likely that another language will be used
in a non-prototype implementation.

## Current state

Enough pieces exist to write basic runnable programs. There is a type system, but it's not wired up
in many places yet so mistakes often go unnoticed at compile time. The standard library is anemic,
and it's not uncommon to encounter bugs in the compiler/runtime.

The current implementation of the runtime is an interpreter, but the plan is to eventually add one
or more backends to allow building native executables.

## What's next?

I'm focused on squashing compiler bugs and establishing solid foundations to build atop. Along the
way I've been slowly fleshing out the type system and standard library.
